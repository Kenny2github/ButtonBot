     * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright

     * Neither the name of the copyright holder nor the names of its
     contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this
     software without specific prior written permission.

     * If this software implements a service, the copyright holder reserves
     the right to use this software to provide that service. That is, unless
     specific prior written permission is obtained, the copyright holder is
     the only party who may provide the service.

          * However, anyone is free to use the service, subject to any
          restrictions that the service provider (i.e. the copyright holder
          and/or parties so permitted) may specify.

          * This restriction applies regardless of whether the software is
          modified, in source or binary form.

          * This restriction does not apply to use of the software for
          development purposes; it only applies to using the software to
          become an alternate provider of the service it implements.
          Colloquially, this clause restricts running a "mirror" of the
          service, as long as the software for the mirror is derived in whole
          or in part from this software.

          * Parties wishing to provide a modified version of the service are
          encouraged to submit their modifications to the copyright holder
          for adoption.
