## Adding Sound Effects By Commands

Let's say you're adding a "foo" button that says "FooBar", whose command description says "Play a Foo sound effect".

1. Type `/cmd file:`
2. Drag/select a ffmpeg-compatible sound file.
3. Send the command. You will be shown a modal.
4. Enter the command name, in this case `foo`.
5. Enter the **exact text** to use as the command text, in this case `FooBar`.
6. Enter the name of the sound effect to put in the command description, in this case `Foo`.
7. Submit the modal.

Or alternatively, if you have the sound as a link instead of a file:

1. Send the command `/cmd`.
2. Enter the command name, in this case `foo`.
3. Enter the **exact text** to use as the command text, in this case `FooBar`.
4. Enter the name of the sound effect to put in the command description, in this case `Foo`.
5. Enter the link to the ffmpeg-compatible sound file (which must end in a file extension), or the youtube-dl-compatible link to the sound file.
6. Submit the modal.
