## Adding Sound Effects By Commands

Let's say you're adding a "foo" button that says "FooBar", whose command description says "Play a Foo sound effect".

1. Run `/cmd`, and when prompted:
2. Send the **exact text** to use as the command text, in this case `FooBar`.
3. Send the name of the sound effect to put in the command description, in this case `Foo`.
4. Send a link to, or upload, a ffmpeg-compatible sound file. This will be used for uploading and playing in voice.
