ButtonBot
=========

A Bruh/NUT/etc-button bot. Using ``/bruh`` as an example, running the command:

- If you're in a voice channel, it joins (if it can), plays the effect, and leaves.
- Otherwise, it uploads the effect's audio file.
- Before doing either, it just says "Bruh."

Adding Sound Effects
